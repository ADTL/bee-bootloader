##UDP bootloader for Atmega328p + ENC28J60

ENC28j60 based atmega328p bootloader.

Uses UDP broadcast messages, therefore there is no need for static IP configuration and dealing with IP conflicts.

Fits into the 4096 byte bootloader area. Might be possible to slim down to 2048 byte.

This bootloader is developed on that hardware: <http://kehribar.me/hardware/ethernetGateway>

Currently works OK but there might be some rough edges.

Comments and issue reports are welcome!
